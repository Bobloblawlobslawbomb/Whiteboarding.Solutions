Question #3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"

//////////////////////////


function compressed(string){
  let chars = string.split('');
  let answer = [];
  let answerCounter = 0;
  for (i=0; i< chars.length - 1; i++){
    if (chars[i] != chars [i+1]){
      continue;
    } else {
      answerCounter ++;

      

      //answer = answer.unshift(answerCounter)
      answer = answer.unshift(chars[i])
    }
    return answer.toString;
  }
}
